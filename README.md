This project involved analyzing a large dataset of 19,000+ soccer players and over 110 attributes sourced from the FIFA 2022 database. The goal was to extract valuable insights from player performance data and identify trends that could be used for talent scouting or team strategy optimization.

Key steps in the project included:

- Data Extraction and Cleaning: The dataset was loaded and processed using Pythonâ€™s Pandas library. I employed data wrangling techniques to handle missing values and ensure data quality.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics and standard deviation measures were calculated to understand the distribution of player attributes, including physical abilities, skills, and market value.
- Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I generated visualizations to identify patterns in the data, such as correlations between player ratings, physical attributes, and potential market value.
- Statistical Analysis: Standard deviation and mean calculations were applied to assess variability in player attributes. Additionally, advanced statistics were employed to quantify performance and market dynamics across different leagues and countries.

This project highlighted my proficiency in data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization, while also showcasing my ability to handle large, real-world datasets. The insights derived from the data could guide decisions in sports analytics or performance management.
